## About
Developed a user-friendly online travel and tourism web application where users can effortlessly book their dream trip by selecting from three exciting packages: Basic, Popular, and Premium. Users can provide their personal details to confirm their trip and will receive a confirmation message upon successful booking.

The project also features an admin panel, allowing administrators to monitor all activities efficiently. Admins can access insights, view total bookings, check revenue generated, review user queries, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tour guides, all conveniently from the admin dashboard.

## User Access
- Explore the entire website.
- Book a trip by providing personal details and selecting a preferred package.
